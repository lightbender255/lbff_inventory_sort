## Future

[ ] Add an example launch.json tailored specifically to lbff_bedrock_inventory_sorter_BP (including the script module UUID from manifest.json) if you want a ready-to-run debug config.

[ ] Add a small PowerShell helper for adding the UWP loopback exemption (with an explicit Admin prompt wrapper) if you'd like that automated.
